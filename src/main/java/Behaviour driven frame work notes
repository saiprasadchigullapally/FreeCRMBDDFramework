                  CUCUMBER--BDD framework (Behaviour  driven developement)
                  
                  
                  1)defining the behaviour of the framework
                  2)Behaviour of the test case.
                  3)Behaviour of the use case.
                  
                  Behaviour =Gherkin language is used to define BDD framework.
                  
                  
                  Note: On the basis of the behaviour in background we write test case.
                  
                  cucumber is available in the form ---JVM/RUby
                  
                  cucumber with JVM (java) we use. Best tool .
                  
                  another tool --JBehave--- available in java.
                  
                  BDD can use with selenium as well unitlevel testing to define testcase
                  
                  Why BDD is getting popularity
                  
                  What are advantages and disadvantages
                  
                  
                  
                  In cucumber we have three components
                  
   1)Feature file                 2)step defination file                                               3)TestRunner
                                  --> we will convert feature file                                   --> In junit we use TestRunner   
                                    corresponding into code.                                         -->To run feature.              
                                --> we use selenium+java+annotaions(cucumber related)                -->To generate the output/report
   --> login.feature            -->                                                                               
   --> all Gherkin keywords 
       is used here.
   -->Different keywords
      1)Given
      2)When
      3)Then
      4)AS
      5)But
      6)* 
      7)scenario
      8)scenario outline
      9)Future  
    with the help of this keywords 
    we will define 
    scenario/scenario Outline for 
    a specific Feature.              
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  Scenario is login into the website and do login
                  
                  steps in automation:
                  
                  1)open browser.
                  2)Launch Url.
                  3)enter username.
                  4)Enter password.
                  5)click on login button.
                   
                   Prereqesites or precondition.
                   
                   1)user should be on homepage.
